The feature vectors extracted were compiled into .csv files for both the train and test sets, which were subsequently used in our framework for feature selection using Mutual Information and classification through Support Vector Machine. 

The best performance results (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall), we have obtained during 5-fold cross validation have been reported in the paper, and can be reproduced using these .csv files in the drive link below:
